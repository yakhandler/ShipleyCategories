UI: Do you want animations for flipping cards? If yes, should they be smooth or instant?
Should the game have sound effects? (e.g., card flip sounds, winning sounds)
Should there be a practice mode? (Single-player against AI)
Will you allow custom categories? (Users adding their own)
Will you track stats like win streaks or best scores?
