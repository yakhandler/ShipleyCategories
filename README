GAME FACILITATION UPDATE
- I want to split the game into 2 different experiences. One for if everyone is in the same room and a single person is operating the game board and one for if everyone is remote and on a group phone call.
- The game as it is right now is built for scenario 1. I want to add a UI element that allows the user to select which experience they want. If they select the remote experience, I want to add the following features


- I want the game to display a randomly generatoed lobby name. When others load the site, there needs to be the standard "Start New Game" button but also a "Join Game" button. 
- When they click "Join Game" they will be prompted to enter the lobby name.
- I then want wach user to be prompted for their player name. 
- I want the game to display a list of all players in the lobby. This is visible to all players once they have entered their name.
- then, any player can click "Start Game" and the game will begin.
- I want each player to see their deck at the botton and center
- make it so both match player have to select who won
   - add option for "Challenge" which will prompt all players to vote. The 2 options will be "That works" and "Not a member of the category"
   - If both players vote for themselves, the prompt all players to vote on who won.
- add an indicator of whose turn it is
